    Overview:

        Shader program 'sprite':
            Get shader desc: sprite_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_color0 = 1
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader sprite = sg_make_shader(sprite_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_color0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .proj = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params, &vs_params, sizeof(vs_params));
